# Binary Heap

**Very** similar to a binary search tree. Each parent can have up to **two** children.

In a **max binary heap**, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.

## Use Cases

- Binary Heaps are used to implement **Priority Queues**, which are *very* commonly used data structures.
- They are also used quite a bit, with **graph traversal** algorithms.

## Big O

* Insertion - **O(log N)**
* Removal - **O(log N)**
* Searching - **O(N)**
